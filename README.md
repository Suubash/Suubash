# Hi! I am a Developer.
I write Front-End codes, prototype a Figma design, write backend codes, and even write some blogs.



## I am more than a developer.
Being developer is not only my skill, I also write blogs on the different topics related to programming. You can read it in `blogs` page or [here](https://chaudharysubash.com.np/blog).

### How my journey started?
It took a long time for me to get into front end development because I was still learning how to code. Before I got into programming, I was primarily interested in learning 3D design with Blender. However, you are all aware that 3D design softwares consume so many resources in the machine that you could literally use it as a heater in your room.

Learning Blender was a time-consuming and painful task. If you have low-end PCs, you literally have to wait 2 - 3 minutes to render a single frame.

Blender couldn't run smoothly on complex scenes on low-end PCs. So I dumped Blender and began learning mobile app development. For creating cross-platform apps, I used `Flutter`, a Google UI toolkit. Days passed, and I was pleased with the Flutter but not completely satisfied. As a result, I began learning React.

I was very pleased with the `React` after writing some react codes. Following my introduction to React, I began studying `NextJS` (a React framework) for Static `Site Generation (SSG)`, `Server Side Rendering (SSR)`, and `Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)`.
